1.Start.
2.Input an array named arr[] of size n from the user.
3.Set the first element as minimum. 
4.Compare minimum with the second element. If the second element is smaller than minimum, assign the second element as minimum.
5.Use swap function for that:
   a.for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++)
   b.Find the minimum element in unsorted array
   c.Set min to i.
   d.for (j = i+1; j < n; j++)
	if (arr[j] < arr[min])
	 Assign min to j.
   e.Swap the found minimum element with the first element
      ie,swap(&arr[min], &arr[i])
   f.End for loop.
   g.End procedure.
5.Compare minimum with the third element. Again, if the third element is smaller, then assign minimum to the third element otherwise do nothing.
6.The process goes on until the last element.
7.Then the sorted array is printed using Display procedure.
8.Stop.
