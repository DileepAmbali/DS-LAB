Algorithm

Operations on polynomials
1.  Create new polynomial
2.  Multiply two polynomials
3.  Display polynomials


define struct polyNode with 3 members: float "coeff", int "exp", self referential pointer "link"

declare 3 polyNode variable pointers: A,B and C. Initialize them to NULL


procedure CreatePolynomial
1.  Start
2.  declare 2 integer variable num and exp and 1 float variable coeff
3.  Read the number of terms in first polynomial, num
4.  repeat num times
        4.1. Read the coefficient and exponent of a term of the first polynomial
        4.2. Create a node of polyNode with the input coefficient and exponents
        4.3. Append the node to the end of list
    End loop
5.  Read the number of terms in second polynomial, num
6.  repeat num times
        6.1. Read the coefficient and exponent of a term of the first polynomial
        6.2. Create a node of polyNode with the input coefficient and exponents
        6.3. Append the node to the end of list
    End loop
7.  End procedure


procedure MultiplyPolynomial
1.  Start
2.  declare 4 pointer valriables of type polyNode: tempA,tempB,tempC,node. Initialize tempA to A, tempB to B and tempC to C
3.  Loop while tempA is not NULL
    3.1 Loop while tempB is not NULL
        i.  tempC = C
        ii. Create a node of polyNode with data (tempA->coeff * tempB->coeff) and (tempA->exp + tempB->exp)
        iii.Loop while tempC->link is not NULL, AND tempC->exp is not node->exp
                tempC = tempC->link
            End loop
        iv. if tempC->exp = node->exp
                tempC->coeff = tempC->coeff + node->coeff;
            else
                tempC->link = node;
            End if
        v. tempB = B
        End loop
    End loop
4.  End procedure


procedure displayPolynomials: polyNode *temp
1.  Start
2.  repeat while temp is not NULL
    2.1 print coeff and exponent of each term
    2.2 temp = temp->link
3.End procedure
